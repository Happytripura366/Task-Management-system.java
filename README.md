Project Proposal : Task Management System
1. Title
 Task Management System
2. Project Description
This project is designed to help individuals or teams manage their daily tasks more efficiently. Users can create, assign, update, and track tasks through a console-based system.
Problem Statement:
 Managing multiple tasks manually is chaotic and lacks structure. Thereâ€™s a need for a simple task tracking system that organizes work efficiently.
Why OOP is Important:
 Using OOP, we can model real-life components like tasks, users, and projects into manageable Java classes. This structure makes the system more reusable, maintainable, and scalable.

3. Project Goals and Functionalities
Goals:
To simplify personal or group task tracking.


To implement OOP design in a real-life scenario.


To support prioritization and monitoring of tasks.


Key Functionalities:
Create and delete tasks.


Set due dates, status, and priority.


Assign tasks to users.


Mark tasks as completed or pending.


Filter tasks based on priority or status.



4. Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java


Frameworks/Libraries: None required


Database: Not required (tasks stored temporarily in memory)



5. Use of OOP Principles
Encapsulation:
 Task and User data are stored in classes with getters and setters for controlled access.


Inheritance:
 The base Task class can be extended into subtypes like PersonalTask or WorkTask.


Polymorphism:
 Overloaded methods can be used to assign tasks differently; overridden methods can manage task updates uniquely per type.


Abstraction:
 The system hides complex logic (e.g., filtering or sorting tasks) behind high-level method calls.



6. Project Phases and Timeline
Phase


Requirement Analysis


Class Design & Planning


Implementation (Code)


Testing and Debugging


Finalization and Submission




7. Final Outcome
A basic task management tool that users can operate via console.


It will help users stay organized and on top of their assignments or responsibilities.



8. Conclusion
This project will demonstrate how Java OOP principles can be applied to solve real-life productivity challenges. It will be useful for individuals or teams and can be easily enhanced in the future.
